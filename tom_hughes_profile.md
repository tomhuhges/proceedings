## short bio

i'm from the wirral (near liverpool). i went to leeds uni to study linguistics + phonetics but not sure why... i graduated in 2008 and moved to london shortly after. i worked as a 'journalist' for a press agency in canary wharf and quit after 6 months because [it was awful](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/01/adam-afriyies-adfero-churnalism).

i decided i wanted to be an illustrator so i did an art + design foundation degree at city lit in 2011. there i made a weird [40-page comic about a man who lied about sailing around the world in the 1960s](http://mercybook.tumblr.com/tagged/mercybook/chrono). after that i made a [kids book about a dolphin who goes into space](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/snckpck/a-swim-through-space-a-childrens-book?ref=live) which went on kickstarter.

i'd planned to do a masters degree in illustration but realised it would probably make me poor for the rest of my life so i joined a company called Springwise after that and worked as a copywriter and designer. for the most part it was me and one other person. we didn't have a developer so because i was good at computers if something needed fixing on the site i did it. i knew how to do a bit of HTML + CSS from tweaking my myspace page (haha). i gradually taught myself html + css properly, and later PHP so I could start adding things to the site. i basically taught myself how to run the site through experimentation, messing about with mySQL databases, apache servers, command line, and generally breaking the site a lot.

eventually the 2 of us managed to sell the company, got a new CEO and ended up hiring some more writers. i became a full time developer for the company. we did a lot of custom projects for big clients so i have some experience of delivering product to deadline. i wanted to move from PHP to javascript so i left in september last year and have been doing a bit of freelancing and mainly teaching myself javascript + development best practices since then.

## current situation

i have some savings which should last me a couple of months. however i don't want to waste it all and am currently looking for jobs. but this project could become something really interesting + i could be willing to work on it in my spare time if i do get a job.

## Current state of learning

### HTML: good

i'm pretty confident in my HTML knowledge, but could always do with brushing up my HTML5 + new stuff

### CSS: not bad, learned it a while ago so needs refreshing

i know how to make something look how i want, but need to learn how to structure my CSS better (BEM/SMACSS etc). i've never really used frameworks like bootstrap, but just started using [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/) which i like.

### JavaScript: good

i've spent like the last 4 months learning js full time so feel pretty confident about my js knowledge ðŸ¤“. my weak points are async, newer features like es6 generators, node and functional programming. have been learning react + redux, as well as app architecture.

## My todo list:

- BEM/SMACSS/CSS frameworks
- more React/Redux
- [performance](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rail)
- TDD
- agile methodology / pair programming

## What I think I can contribute

i'm still really interested in design so would like to be involved there. can use Sketch, Photoshop/Illustrator/InDesign etc.

i'm not particularly organized or good with people, but hopefully my previous dev experience will be useful. happy to get involved in teaching/mentoring.
