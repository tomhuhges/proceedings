# Coder's Co-operative - Member Introduction

## Mark Mitchell

## Short Bio

I was born in Glasgow in 1977. When I was about 8 I got a Sinclair ZX Spectrum 48k+ and wrote some BASIC, did some rudimentary games hacking etc.

Computer studies at school was useless and my interests drifted in other directions. The next time I had much reason to use a computer was as a humanities student at Glasgow University in 1995. It was all Windows and I didn't know what was going on. Any idea that I was "good with computers" left me at that stage. I felt like I'd missed the boat.

Not knowing what to do with myself, I took a job in a Cable & Wireless call centre in about 2001 and helped launch a technical helpdesk contract there.

So when I moved to London in 2007 I worked in comms maintenance on the London Underground, then moved to a network comms helpdesk for a year. I spent 6 months in Manchester supporting mobile network services, and when I came back to London in 2009 I took a position as 3rd line technician supporting mobile credit card terminals.

I spent the next 6 years working my way up through that company: technical supervisor, customer service team leader, operations manager, project manager.

For the last year I've been at London Metropolitan University as a project manager, but that has been a very difficult time for me and has made me realise that I need a change of career.

Ever since I got a raspberry pi in 2012 I've been a huge linux enthusiast and it has given me back my confidence to learn and be in control of technology.

Therefore - CODING. A return to my childhood obsession!

## Personal Life

I have a long-term partner, a three-year old son, and our second child is due in June 2017.

Not having got in to FAC10, I have an equivalent period in which to train myself up and find work. It will start to get pretty hairy for me financially from June if my partner is on statutory maternity leave an I have no income. I'm not going to worry about that until closer to the time.

## Current state of learning

### HTML: rudimentary

I only know enough to make things work in a functional way. I feel I am long way off "production" code, especially in relation to responsiveness, cross-device and cross-browser compatibility. I'm aware that there are HTML extension tools (like Pug) out there, but I have not experimented with them.

### CSS: OK

I've made some big leaps with CSS recently via the cssdailyimages challenge. I've got a handle on postioning elements in relation to each other and have started playing around with css animations.

### JavaScript: functional but clunky, missing big chunks

Decent grasp of the basics but not much experience using it in real-world scenarios. I'm starting to experiment with maipulating the DOM and triggering functions with onclick events and so forth, but again, I feel I'm behind compared to other FAC10 applicants.

## My todo list:

* jekyll (in progress)
* write "proper" html (browser/device compatibility, semantic structuring, frameworks and grids, breakpoints, @media rules etc)
* adhere to recognised stylistic approaches (eg BEM)
* try SASS, SCSS, etc
* identify and fill gaps in knowledge that might be expected by prospective employers
* get *real* work, whether for relatives/friends etc and practice builing *real* sites inlcuding all the "boring" stuff

## What I think I can contribute

I feel that my professional background has given me some good insight into the way organisations tend to behave, and the sorts of positive and negative dynamics that affect them.

I am PRINCE2 certified practitioner (for what it's worth!) and although I have never used agile approaches to project management, I am very interested in them and am keen to apply the principles of scrum to various aspects of the co-op. 

I have a good deal of experience designing and documenting business processes and establishing effective management structures. 

Although I am not a leader by inclination, I am happy to accept responsibility if I know I have a legitimate remit. 

I'm kind of obsessed with organisational learning and the effective use of media an technical tools to serve the org's needs. I love to experiment with incentives and productivity techniques, and although I might come across as a bit conservative and controlling, I'm actually very comfortable with change and flux and I enjoy taking radical and irreverent approaches to problems.

Although no expert, I'm comfortable at the command line, messing around with config files, setting up and configuring linux systems etc. 

I'm also prone to a bit of illustration and graphic design, and can find my way around photoshop, GIMP etc pretty well. 

## Personality

My myers-briggs personality type is a solid [INTJ](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=intj&atb=v4&ia=web)
